Use REST APIs to;
1. query active user sessions across all host pools,
2. disconnect idle sessions exceeding timeout thresholds,
3. log off sessions for maintenance windows or license compliance,
4. send messages to users notifying them of impending system maintenance,
5. and generate session reports showing peak usage times and concurrent user counts.
